125 years ago, who would've thought this to be possible?  Well humans, it's been a good ride, but after being eviscerated by 51 IBM's supercomputer Watson on "Jeopardy!," it's 94 probably time to pack up the truck and let the machines inherit the Earth.  222 Or is it?  -15 Despite Watson's tremendous performance, the Final Jeopardy question at the end of Tuesday night's airing revealed the Achilles' heel that computer scientists have known all along: Watson doesn't really 98 "think" anything, and it struggles with simple questions that most humans can answer without a 314 second thought.  Most of the clues on the "Jeopardy!" board mention proper nouns -- specific places, events, people, songs, books and so on, says Dr. Douglas Lenat, a machine learning pioneer, former Stanford professor of computer science and CEO of Cycorp, 216 a company that develops semantic technologies.  -52 "This gives the Watson algorithm a great deal of 'traction.' To us viewing the show, it's impressive if it correctly knows that Franz Schubert's birth date was January 31, 1797. But if that date had been part of the clue, could Watson correctly pick out [Schubert's] maternal grandmother's birth date from a list where only one of the dates was earlier than 1797?"  Jeopardy' contestant versus computer Watson gets a job  We could, because we understand that everyone is younger than their own mother and grandmother, but Watson is unable to understand this, Lenat explained.  At the end of the day, Watson is not really conceptualizing a clue's meaning. It simply number-crunches its way to the right answers by comparing vast amounts of data. This is why it dominates the "fill in the blank" knowledge clues (Aeolic, spoken in ancient times, was a dialect of this), but falters on some more "common sense" deductions.
